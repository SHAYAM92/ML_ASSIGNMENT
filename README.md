# Earthquake Data Clustering , Analysis and Reinforcement Learning
## Overview
This project aims to analyze global earthquake data using Clustering Algorithms to identify patterns and group similar earthquakes based on their characteristics. The goal is to utilize clustering techniques like K-Means and Mean Shift to categorize earthquakes into distinct clusters based on parameters such as magnitude, depth, and location.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of global earthquake records, which include various features that help in understanding earthquake characteristics and behavior. The primary features used for clustering are:

# Features:
+ Magnitude: The magnitude of the earthquake (measured on the Richter scale).
+ Depth: The depth of the earthquake in kilometers.
+ Latitude: The geographical latitude where the earthquake occurred.
+ Longitude: The geographical longitude where the earthquake occurred.
+ Location: The textual description of the earthquake's location.
# Clustering Process:
To group earthquakes into clusters, different clustering algorithms are utilized, including K-Means Clustering and Mean Shift Clustering. These algorithms help in identifying groups of earthquakes with similar characteristics.

# Clustering Algorithm: K-Means
The features are standardized to ensure proper clustering.
The algorithm is configured to define a specific number of clusters based on the data distribution.
After clustering, each earthquake is labeled with its respective cluster.
# Clustering Algorithm: Mean Shift
Mean Shift does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters and identifies clusters based on the density of data points.
This algorithm is effective in identifying clusters of arbitrary shape.
# Visualizations and Evaluation
+ Initial Clusters: A visualization showing the initial clusters formed by K-Means and Mean Shift algorithms.
+ Final Clusters: Graphical representation of the final clusters after the algorithms have converged.
+ Epoch Size: Display the number of iterations taken for the algorithms to converge.
+ Error Rate: Assessment of clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score and adjusted Rand index.
# How to Run
+ Load the earthquake dataset (update the path in the script).
+ Execute the K-Means clustering process to group the earthquakes.
+ Execute the Mean Shift clustering process to identify clusters based on density.
+ Visualize the initial and final clusters using scatter plots.
+ Evaluate the clustering performance using appropriate metrics.
# Results
After clustering, the results will provide insights into the distribution of earthquakes based on their magnitude, depth, and geographical location. The clusters can help in understanding earthquake patterns and potential risks associated with different regions.
